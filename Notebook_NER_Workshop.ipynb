        "| **Annotated data** | Training needs examples where entities are *already labeled* in text, e.g. `\"Redpill\" → IDEOLOGY`. | The model can only learn from what it sees.<br><br>More examples and variety = better generalization. |\n",
        "| **Empty model**<br/>`spacy.blank(\"en\")` | Creates a model with **no prior knowledge** (\"a clean slate\"). | Ideal for demos or custom domains.<br><br>The model learns entirely from the input data. |\n",
        "| **Pretrained model**<br/>`en_core_web_sm` | A model that already understands **general English** syntax and entities. | You can **fine-tune** it instead of training from scratch.<br><br>This saves time and requires less data. |\n",
        "| **Adding an NER component** | spaCy pipelines are sequences like:<br/>`tokenizer → tagger → parser → NER`. | Adding an NER step lets the model detect and label entities (e.g., `PERSON`, `ORG`, or custom ones like `IDEOLOGY`). |\n",
        "| **Token alignment & BILUO tags** | spaCy internally converts entity spans into the **BILUO** format:<br>**B**egin, **I**nside, **L**ast, **U**nit, **O**utside. | Ensures that entity spans match token boundaries.<br><br>This alignment is **essential for error-free training**. |\n",
        "| **Epochs / iterations** | One “epoch” = one **full pass** through the dataset. Training repeats over multiple epochs. | Each pass helps the model refine its understanding.<br><br>More epochs → more learning (to a point). |\n",
        "| **Updating model weights** | After every batch, spaCy adjusts internal **weights** based on the difference between predictions and correct labels. | These updates make the model gradually improve.<br><br>Over many updates, accuracy and stability increase. |\n",
